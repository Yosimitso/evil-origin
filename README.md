Intro
=============================

During the longest night among decades,

A dazzling meteor strikes,

with a tremendous power the land of Mellitela,


The ecosystem is bruised, a myriad of field crops are destroyed,

In addition, creatures are popping from the womb of earth, 

Annihilating everything on their way like a hurricane,


The king Henry II, proud owner of these lands,

is overwhelmed by the disaster,

He observes his people weeping, starving, dying, revolting,


Leaving their shelters to join a den of bandit,

Chaos is about to be the new ruler,

But his Majesty has no intention to give up his kingdom,


he demands to a small group of volunteers,

to find and settle the source of chaos,

in exchange of a promise of wealth and full autonomy
